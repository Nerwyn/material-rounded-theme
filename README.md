# Material Rounded Theme

Material Rounded theme for Home Assistant influenced by Material You on Android.

This theme aims to match the styling of the Google Home app as closely as possible, so it may change over time as the style of the Google Home app changes.

Relies on [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) for header/footer modifications. If you have card-mod installed and do not want these changes to apply, use the "No Mod" version of this theme. This theme also includes a "Transparent Card" version with transparent card backgrounds to be used at the individual card level if you want a card to be transparent for convenience.

Light cards made using [Big Slider Card](https://github.com/nicufarmache/lovelace-big-slider-card). Use the following style settings to match:

```yaml
colorize: true
show_percentage: true
bold_text: true
height: 88
```

# Installation

1. Navigate to HACS (install from [here](https://hacs.xyz/) if you do not have it yet).
2. Navigate to `Frontend`.
3. Click `+ EXPLORE & DOWNLOAD REPOSITORIES` and search for `Material Rounded Theme`.
4. Open this repository in HACS and click `DOWNLOAD`.
5. Refresh Home Assistant.
6. Navigate to your Profile, and select `Material Rounded` under Theme along with your preference for light or dark mode.

# Card Mod Powered Footer

This theme uses [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) to:

-   Turn the toolbar header into a footer.
-   Remove the selection bar.
-   Space the view icons evenly along the entire toolbar.
-   Add the view name below the icon.
-   Highlight the current view with a colored icon and background behind the icon.
-   Add a 12px margin to each side of the view.

Also check out [Material Symbols](https://github.com/beecho01/material-symbols) to use updated material icons, as shown in the screenshots!

This theme was initially modified from the [Graphite theme](https://github.com/TilmanGriesel/graphite), as I found that it was my favorite of the available Home Assistant themes on HACS when I started creating this theme. Therefore, it contains similar logic for reusing variables and possibly some unused variables.
