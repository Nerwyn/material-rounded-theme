# Material You - A Fully Featured Implementation of Material Design 3 Theme for Home Assistant

A theme for Home Assistant influenced by Google apps and Material Design 3 by Google on Android.

This theme is made up of three main components:

1. A standard Home Assistant theme yaml file.
2. [Card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) powered [Material Design 3 redesigns of elements](#material-you-components-powered-by-card-mod).
3. [User defined Material You color theme](#material-you-color-theme-generation) generation via either a JavaScript module or [Material Theme Builder](#build-your-own-theme).

This theme implements Material Design 3 redesigns of elements when possible using [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod). If you have card-mod installed and do not the component redesigns, use the "No Mod" versions of this theme. If you want partial card-mod component modifications you must modify and recompile the theme yourself as described [at the end of the README](#developing-modifying-and-building-the-theme).

You can choose a your own Material You base color! [See below for more](#material-you-color-theme-generation). Requires an additional JS resource script. Does not require card-mod. You can also choose from several alternate color schemes and tweak theme contrast.

This theme also includes "Transparent Card" versions with transparent card backgrounds. It also includes separate light and dark versions of all themes for niche use cases. These variations are combined into many different versions of the theme.

Everything in Home Assistant has been updated to use colors generated using [Material Color Utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities) following the [Material Design 3 guidelines](https://m3.material.io/). It supports custom user colors for virtually all of Home Assistant. If no user base color is provided the themes defaults to a shade of blue, `#4C5C92`.

</p>

## Basic Installation

1. Navigate to HACS (install from [here](https://hacs.xyz/) if you do not have it yet).
2. Navigate to `Frontend`.
3. Click `+ EXPLORE & DOWNLOAD REPOSITORIES` and search for `Material You Theme`.
4. Open this repository in HACS and click `DOWNLOAD`.
5. (Optional) Install [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) from HACS to take advantage of the Material You components [described below](#material-you-components-powered-by-card-mod).
6. Refresh your browser or close and open your app.
7. Navigate to your Profile, and select `Material You` or one of its variants.
   - **If you set the theme at the view level, it will not style the anything outside of the view. The view tabs are outside of the view.**
8. (Optional) Follow the [instructions below](#material-you-colors) for installing the companion Material You Color JavaScript module resource, or for creating your own theme.

## Material You Color Theme Generation

This theme supports Material You color theming! This requires either an additional JavaScript module resource or use of [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/). The JavaScript module resource can either be downloaded from this repository or used using a CDN URL.

If you do not want to install the JavaScript module but do want your own color theme, skip ahead to [Build Your Own Theme](#build-your-own-theme)

### (Optional) Download JavaScript Module Resource Locally in Home Assistant

While the module should be cached in browser after first use, you can download it locally to ensure that Material You Color theming works offline.

1. Download the module from this repository [here](https://github.com/Nerwyn/material-rounded-theme/blob/main/dist/material-rounded-theme.js).
2. Upload this module to your Home Assistant instance, preferable in the `config/www` folder.
   - Your `configuration.yaml` file is found in the `config` folder. If the `www` folder does not exist create it. More information about the configuration folder can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/#to-find-the-configuration-directory).

**Remember!** You must update your local copy of this module manually as update are made. Release notes will call out JavaScript module changes.

### Add the Module as a Resource

1. Navigate to a dashboard and then click `ðŸ–‰ Edit dashboard` > `â‹® Open dashboard menu` > `Manage resources`.
2. Click `+ ADD RESOURCE`.
3. In the `URL` field enter the path to the resource file.
   - `/local/material-rounded-theme.js` if downloaded to your Home Assistant instance.
   - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/nerwyn/material-rounded-theme@main/dist/material-rounded-theme.js if using the CDN version.
4. Select `Resource Type` `JavaScript module`.
5. Click `CREATE`.
6. Hard refresh (`CTRL` + `F5`) your browser or clear app/browser cache to ensure the new resource loads correctly.

### (Optional) Add the Module as a Frontend Module

Adding this module as a frontend module will cause it to load sooner, prevent the intitial flash of the default color, and possibly fix issues with Home Assistant resources not loading on non-dashboard pages.

1. Open your `configuration.yaml` (see above for information about the configuration folder).
2. Add the file URL to `frontend` `extra_module_url`, adding the `frontend` and `extra_module_url` keys if they do not exist, and adding to them if they do.

```yaml
frontend:
  extra_module_url:
    - /local/material-rounded-theme.js # Or the CDN URL listed above
```

3. Restart Home Assistant.

### Create a Template Sensor Helper

Once the JavaScript module resource has been added, create a helper template sensor named `Material You Base Color` that returns the hex code of your preferred base color. The theme colors will be calculated using [Material Color Utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities).

1. Navigate to `Settings` > `Devices & services` > ` Helpers`.
2. Click `+ CREATE HELPER`.
3. Click `Template`.
4. Click `Template a sensor`.
5. Name the sensor `Material You Base Color`. The sensor entity ID should be `sensor.material_you_base_color`.
6. Enter your Material You base color as a hex code, e.g. `238636`, `#db4437`, `#fff`. You can also use a template to read a hex code from the state or attribute of a different entity, like `{{ states("sensor.pixel_fold_accent_color") }}`.
7. Click `SUBMIT`.

You can also choose user specific colors by creating a sensor named `Material You Base Color Your Name`, with your name being your person name as it appears on the [Home Assistant people page](http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/person). The sensory entity ID should be something like `sensor.material_you_base_color_john_doe`. Alternatively, you can use your user ID as found on the [Home Assistant users page](http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/users) when you click on a user. In this case the sensor entity ID should be something like `sensor.material_you_base_color_f8866a924fc94c4d8abde860584afd05`.

You may find it useful to also create a text helper, and to then set the base color sensor to its state using a template like `{{ states("input_text.material_you_base_color") }}`.

### Alternate Schemes and Contrast

In addition to the modern Android color scheme, [Material Color Utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities) offers several alternate schemes. You can use these schemes by creating helper template sensors similar to the base color sensors above with the name `Material You Scheme` (sensor entity ID `sensor.material_you_scheme`).

| Monochrome  | A Dynamic Color theme that is grayscale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

If an invalid or no scheme is provided, it will default to `Scheme Tonal Spot`. You may find it useful to create a dropdown helper with all of the above scheme names as options, and to then set the scheme sensor to its state using a template like `{{ states("input_select.material_you_scheme") }}`.

Each scheme can also be provided with a custom contrast from -1 to 1. Value outside of this range are clamped to it. If an invalid or no value is provided it will default to `0`. You may find it useful to create a number helper with minimum value -1 and maximum value 1, and to then set the contrast sensor to its state using a template like `{{ states("input_number.material_you_scheme") }}`

If no base color is provided but scheme or contrast is, it will default to `#4C5C92`. If an invalid hex color is provided, theme colors will be removed and the theme will use its default colors.

### Home Assistant Android App Color Sensor

If you are using the Home Assistant Android companion app, you can enable the accent color sensor in the companion app settings to use your phone's Material You accent color as the theme base color:

1. Navigate to `Settings` > `Companion app`.
2. Click `Manage sensors.`
3. Scroll down to the section titled `Dynamic color` and click `Accent color`.
4. Toggle `Enable sensor` on. It should now return your phone's Material You base color as a hex code.

Then create a base color template sensor as described above, and use a template to return the state of your companion app accent color sensor.

## Build Your Own Theme

If you do not want to use the JavaScript module resource or create helper sensors, you can instead create your own Material Theme using [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/).

**NOTE**: themes created this way will not apply to iframes such as the HACS and Add-ons pages. It will also not apply to some page backgrounds like the settings and developer tools pages, which are hardcoded to a default color.

1. Navigate to [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/).
2. Choose your theme colors. You can skip picking fonts, they are not saved to the exported files.
3. Click `Export theme`, click `Export`, and then click `Web (CSS)`.
4. Extract the CSS files from the downloaded zip archive and open the css folder within it.
5. Choose a matching set of light and dark css files with the same contrast extension (or mix and match) and open them in a text editor.
   - `light.css` and `dark.css` are standard, `-mc` is medium contrast, and `-hc` is high contrast.
6. Find and replace (`CTRL` + `F`) all colons `:` in the CSS files and replace them with `-light:` in the light file and `-dark:` in the dark file.
7. Copy all of the variables from one file to the other, and rename the selector (`.dark`, `.light-high-contrast`, etc) to `html`. It should look something like this:

```css
html {
  --md-sys-color-primary-dark: rgb(242 220 130);
  --md-sys-color-surface-tint-dark: rgb(219 198 110);
  --md-sys-color-on-primary-dark: rgb(45 37 0);
  --md-sys-color-primary-container-dark: rgb(163 144 63);
  ...
  --md-sys-color-surface-container-lowest-light: rgb(255 255 255);
  --md-sys-color-surface-container-low-light: rgb(250 243 229);
  --md-sys-color-surface-container-light: rgb(238 232 218);
  --md-sys-color-surface-container-high-light: rgb(227 220 207);
  --md-sys-color-surface-container-highest-light: rgb(215 209 196);
}
```

8. (Optional) Rename the file to something recognizable, like `material-design-colors.css`

9. Upload this file to your Home Assistant instance, preferable in the config/www folder.
   - Your `configuration.yaml` file is found in the `config` folder. If the `www` folder does not exist create it. More information about the configuration folder can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/#to-find-the-configuration-directory).
10. Navigate to a dashboard and then click `ðŸ–‰ Edit dashboard` > `â‹® Open dashboard menu` > `Manage resources`.
11. Click `+ ADD RESOURCE`.
12. In the `URL` field enter the path to the resource file.
    - Like `/local/material-design-colors.css`
13. Select `Resource Type` `Stylesheet`.
14. Click `CREATE`.
15. Hard refresh (`CTRL` + `F5`) your browser or clear app/browser cache to ensure the new resource loads correctly.

## Material You Components, Powered By Card Mod

This theme is super-charged by [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)! Using card-mod many components have received Material You design upgrades.

### Navigation

Redesigns the toolbar and sidebar buttons to follow Material You navigation component guidelines.

#### [Top App Bar](https://m3.material.io/components/top-app-bar/overview)

- Retains the sidebar toggle and dashboard menu (small width screens) or action items (large width screens) from the navigation toolbar header in a top app bar.
- Non-view buttons appear at top of screen near their original locations.
- Adds the current view title to the center.
- Height increased to 64px.
- Disappears when user is not scrolled to the top of the view.
- Use a variant color for trailing buttons and edit mode.

#### [Navigation Bar](https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-bar/overview)

- Converts the toolbar header view tabs bar into a navigation bar footer.
- Removes the default selection bar and ripple.
- Spaces the view icons evenly along the entire toolbar.
  - While evenly spacing the icons should (and previously) be done by making their parent a flexbox, their parent is within a shadow-root which the view tabs are slotted into. Modifying this parent element with card-mod is possible but it is slow and inconsistent. A tab count and width calculation method is used instead, which is much faster and more consistent.
- Adds view names below the view icons.
- Increase font weight of current view tab name.
- Highlights the current view with a colored icon and background behind the icon.
- Transition animation on view icon background when selected.
- [State layers](https://m3.material.io/foundations/interaction/states/state-layers) on hover, focus, and press.

#### [Navigation Drawer](https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-drawer/overview)

Desktop sidebar expanded and mobile.

- Icon and background of current page now uses primary and accent colors.
- Transition animation on view icon background when selected.
- Badge background color removed and color set to same as icon and text.
- Increase font weight of current page name.
- [State layers](https://m3.material.io/foundations/interaction/states/state-layers) on hover, focus, and press.

#### [Navigation Rail](https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-rail/overview)

Desktop sidebar collapsed.

- Background of current page now uses primary and accent colors.
- Current view icon background is a circle to match Material You example of a navigation rail menu without labels.
- Badge colors changed to material design error colors (red).
- [State layers](https://m3.material.io/foundations/interaction/states/state-layers) on hover, focus, and press.

### [Switches](https://m3.material.io/components/switch/overview)

- Track now encompasses thumb.
- Removes the default ripple in favor of a thumb that changes size when used.
- Uses material design colors for the switch thumb, track, and outline.
- [State layers](https://m3.material.io/foundations/interaction/states/state-layers) on hover, focus, and press.

### Views

- Adds an 82px margin to the bottom of the view for the navigation bar when it is present.
  - The navigation bar is not present on subviews and single view dashboards.
  - This padding is also removed in kiosk mode.
- Add card button of classic lovelace views updated to better match the [extended FAB specification](https://m3.material.io/components/extended-fab/overview).
  - The add card button is within a shadow-root and does not style consistently. If the button does not appear it is likely underneath the navigation bar, and should appear if you refresh the page while still in edit mode.
- Increase `--ha-sections-view-row-gap` to 18px, which is also used for the column gap on mobile displays to match Google Home app.

If you do not want these changes, use the "No Mod" versions of the theme. If you only want some of these changes, you will have to modify and recompile the theme yourself.

This theme revolves around Material Design 3 and the tooling that its contributors have made available, especially [Material Color Utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities) and the [Material Design 3 specification](https://m3.material.io/).

### LCARS Theme

The [Star Trek LCARS theme](https://github.com/th3jesta/ha-lcars) for Home Assistant also uses a JavaScript module resource for advanced theme modification, and I used it as a basis for getting started on my Material You color theming JavaScript module.

### Graphite Theme

This theme was initially modified from [Graphite theme](https://github.com/TilmanGriesel/graphite), as it was my favorite Home Assistant theme on HACS before I created this one.

## Developing, Modifying, and Building The Theme

Due to the multiple versions and complexity of this theme, I have split it into multiple CSS and yaml files and created a Python git pre-commit build pipeline to compile all of the files into a single Home Assistant theme file. You can either run this build pipeline by making a git commit (after setting up githooks and not to the main repo, of course) running the file `build.sh`, or running the `pre-commit.py` Python file.

Twelve versions of this theme are generated - with card mod, without card mod, transparent cards with card mod, transparent cards without card mod, and a separate light and dark version of each. The no card mod versions of theme have the `card-mod-theme` fields removed and will have no design upgrades, but do use user defined colors. The separate light and dark versions of the theme are if you need to explicitly set a device to use light or dark mode without the Home Assistant built in theme mode options.

Any files under common that end in `.yaml` are treated as `card-mod-*-yaml` fields in the themes, and files ending in `.css` contain the actual card-mod CSS. The `material_you.yaml` file in the `src` folder is the base theme, and is functionally equivalent to `Material You No Mod`. CSS styles are copied into the card-mod yaml fields using jinja templates, allowing for repetitive styles that go in different shadow roots to all source from the same file. The view tabs count jinja template is also rendered to create a CSS style. The final output theme file should have no jinja.
